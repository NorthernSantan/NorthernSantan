# Colin McCormack Profile

I am currently a grade 12 student looking for a coding internship, coop, or related part time work. 

I am a self taught web developer, who has made two full stack applications, which are both available to view on my GitHub. I have also gone above and beyond in my computer science courses at school by integrating GitHub and other modern services with the Ontario high school curriculum. 

My first big coding project was writing a script to complete a repetitive online form using Python. 
I followed this up with a website to show off this program and since then I have been working on a wide range of projects to develop my coding knowledge. 
Over the summer my primary focus was on the development of an all-in-one scheduling application using Node JS, hosted on AWS. 
I am also an active participant on GitHub and Stack Overflow, answering questions and offering suggestions to other coders.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Scheduling Software
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Gooogle Cloud Services
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects for beginners.
